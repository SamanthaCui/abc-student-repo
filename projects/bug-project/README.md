## Quick Access
The chrome extention can be easily download [here](https://github.com/SamanthaCui/abc-student-repo/raw/master/projects/bug-project/bug-project.zip).

## Description
Remember the days when you go on Wikipedia and copy/paste some definitions straight to your homework?<br/>
<br/>
Well, you're in "luck"!<br/>
Try and do that with this Chrome extension. :P

BTW: Try and see what happens if you click the mouse.
