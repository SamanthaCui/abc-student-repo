## Quick Access
The website can be easily accessed [here](https://samanthacui.github.io/abc-student-repo/projects/project-a/a-interactive/). (Best to open with Chrome) 

## Description
This project takes inspiration from the Alcohol Art form. Utilizing CSS animation, it hopes to recreate the process of when watery paint meeting each other and blending. 

## Challenges
For the first version of my project, it was more of a "performance". There was no interaction. I was happy with the visual effects. But it still felt like something was missing. I then discussed it with Professor Leon on how we could make it more interactive. Through several rounds of changes, it led to the current version.

## Compromises
Unlike other javascript libraries, it's rather difficult trying to make curvy shapes using CSS. So I had to come up with an alternative way to create how the paint will spread on the "paper". I've tried using ovals, but it seemed messy. So in the end, I had to settle with creating circles. I layered them with each other than adjusted the opacity. I then took advice from the professor and coded that multiple circles would be created on a single mouse click. It gave it a perfect liquid touch. :D

## Shortcomings
For the version now, sometimes it doesn't respond when you tap. It will work if you tap again harder. I'm still uncertain what is causing this glitch. Hopefully, I'll fix it in the future. :)
