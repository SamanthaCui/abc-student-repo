## Quick Access
The website can be easily accessed [here](https://samanthacui.github.io/abc-student-repo/projects/project-a/a-interactive/).

## Description
This project takes inspiration of the Alcohol Art form. Utilizing CSS animation, it hopes to recreate the process of when watery paint meeting each other, and blending together. 

## Challenges
For the first version of my project, it was more of a "performance". There was no interaction. I was happy with the visual effects. But it still felt like something was missing. I then discussed it with Professor Leon on how we could make it more interactive. Through several rounds of changes, it led to the current version.

## Compromises
Unlike other javascript libraries, it's rather difficult trying to make curvy shapes using CSS. So I had to come up with a alternitive way to create how paint will spread on the "paper". I've tried using ovals, but it seemed messy. So in the end, I had to settle with creating circles. I layered them with each other then adjusted the opacity. I then took advice from the professor and coded that multiple circles would be created on single mouse click. It gave it a perfect liquid touch. :D
