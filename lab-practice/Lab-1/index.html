    <!-- <p id="content">Your room will change throughout the semester, you will learn new tricks and want to tweak, add, remove parts of your design of the room. That is fine, even expected. It is necessary (and relevant to grading) however that you think about your choices at this point already. The focus should be primarily on the visual design, then on the technical execution. The room itself must not be an artwork. It is a platform on which to present your art.</p> -->
