## Response to Online Intimacy Readings

In my opinion, online communication would both help and damage relationships. As Gene McHugh mentioned in the article, “Many cultures have evolved various internet-specific ways to flirt and show affection so that people can now have ‘natural’ interactions without being in the same room”.
Ans this is not strictly targeted towards romantic relationships. This situation also applies when we chat with our family and friends. We use emojis and gifs to vividly express our feelings. Several popular internet catchphrases have emerged due to this form of communication. We FaceTime each other to have a real-time conversation. These vast developments in online communication methods have benefited our lives a lot by providing the possibility to keep in touch with people far away. This advantage has enhanced under the situation of the global pandemic, which has come in great help to bond people while social distancing.  

With online communication taking up so much in our everyday life, another question emerges. This was a question I saw in a social science questionnaire, in what form of communication would you consider yourself to be logistically communicative, chatting online or offline? I was surprised by the results when most of the people chose to be more communicative online, while I considered myself to be more communicative offline. Gene McHugh mentioned in the article about people lying about their online identity during a conversation. It’s easy to pretend to be someone you are not on the internet. Some would chew it as an advantage to add more freedom to the conversations, which allows them to become more chatty. However, just because it’s so easy for people to pretend, I prefer the more direct way of communicating offline. What would your answer be to this question?
