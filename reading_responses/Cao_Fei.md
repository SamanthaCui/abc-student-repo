## Response to Cao Fei and Eva and Franco Mattes

It was hard trying to grasp what exactly did the RMB City project looked like and it’s interaction design. So I after reading the article I went online and found a video that shows in more depth the visual elements designed. From the version of this project being displayed in that video, when you look at it from afar, the city seemed like mashing all the famous sceneries in China into an island. The odd placement of this architecture, some being lied down and tilted, made me wonder if this was a functioning island or just a memorial to some of the forgotten cultures. Once the video starts going into the island and wandering around, I started to see that it was a “live” city with cars, ships, and people “living” inside it. The structure of the island reminds me of multiple unique Chinese cities’ structures. It was very inspiring how the designer plays around with not only the 3D space but also the viewing distance of users within this project. What we see from a distance might seem completely different when you take a closer look. Another project I came to mind that plays around with this “Z-axis” space was the Check Republic mentioned in class. As we zoom further out of the website, those little singular checkboxes start to form messages. It’s interesting to find an unexpected “3-dimensional” experience in such a webpage.
