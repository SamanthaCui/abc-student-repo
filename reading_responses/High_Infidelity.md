## Response to High Infidelity by Elvia Wilk

It is considered difficult to not wear some form of mask while in a virtual setting. With everything happening behind a screen, people have gotten used to using words, emojis and photos to communicate and connect. As these are all part of the virtual body we create, they’ve done us a huge favor, whether it’s hiding or expressing our biological body.

Think of the last time when you used an emoji as a response to others to avoid embarrassment. If the conversation took place in real life, would you respond the same as the emoji? These elements we use during communication in a virtual setting sometimes plays an important role to hide how we really feel. When you interact with someone online, without seeing their biological body response, you would believe in what they show you. From this point of view, the virtual body becomes a perfect disguise for the biological body.

On the other hand, often the times people design their virtual bodies to reflect on their inner psychological “body”. In other words, it expresses their true self. Some might create an image of the person they want to become. For others it might be a safe place to share their secret interests. You might be a high school physics teacher in real life, but a author on the Internet. You might be a Lawyer in real life, but an online magician performer. Since no one knows who you are in real life, you are limitless in how you want to express yourself.

We use the virtual body to both hide and express ourselves. So, which is more real, the Internet or reality? I guess the author answered it with “actual and virtual are simply ‘differing modes of reality’”.
