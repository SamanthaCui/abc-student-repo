## Response to Net Art's Corporate Turn

The relationship between net art being seen in context, is just the same with people’s judgements influenced by personal experience. Expect in this case, it’s an experience the world goes through together. The internet experience took a big turn during the 1990s-2000s. As internet becomes a rather accessible and  essential tool for people use, companies found a new market. Following that, the projects being created seemed to have shifted all together from personal blogs to more that are capitalization creations. In this way, I believe its more context being imbedded in the project itself rather than people looking through them with the context in mind.

In the reading piece, the author took a great deal on giving business and net art examples to back up his viewpoint. One project I found interesting is Samsung, created by Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries in 1999. I’m somewhat familiar with this brand as I remember my first cellphone being a Samsung flip phone. The project created in 1999, it praises on how life-saving Samsung has become to the people in South Korea. The project used bold all caps fonts, fast-moving animation and light-hearted jazz music to indicate the bright future the company is bringing into the world. But as you look at the content mentioned in the article, where some people suffer through depression when Samsung inflected the market, then you look at the project again, it just seemed ironic and reflects the foolishness. As I looked down at the project page for Samsung, I discovered there was a modified 2017 version. The music seemed to be changed into a more jumpy techno music. And the fonts became even bigger. I wondered why the creator thought of doing a new 2017 version. Maybe it’s to indicate that even though 18 years has past, people are still being controlled.
