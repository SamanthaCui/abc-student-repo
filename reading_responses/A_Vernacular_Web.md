## Response to A Vernacular Web by Olia Lialina

While reading these two articles, it resonated with me so much that I kept forgetting it was actually written 13 years ago. Maybe because these old designs that were mentioned are gradually making a come-back as the retro fever goes on. There’s no doubt the internet has developed rapidly since 2007, and it has been much more easy for people to access.

The question, “How does the Web look now, when it’s no longer seen as the technology of the future” got me quite intrigued. This question relates to many other technologies. From what I’ve seen, besides keep creating more advanced products, people do show a tendency to revisit the originals. When I read these two articles, I thought the webpage design and layout was very interesting and creative. I will design a website like this even though I’ve seen so many websites with more advanced functions that were created after 2007. An example from another technology where a retro theme is popular would be the comeback of disposable cameras.  

Besides being a fan of the retro theme, the more advanced web development throughout the years took advantages of the increase usage of the mobile internet access. One of my first memories of surfing the Web was actually to use my mom’s computer and register for QQ. Back then we would need to go back home and use the computer to chat with our friends versus what we could do on our phones now. 

How the Web looks now, is simply a mixture between the past and the future.
